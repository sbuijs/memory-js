# memory-js

This project is created for the purpose of learning Vanilla JS. 
Within this project I've learned various things like, working with a Class, objects, shuffeling an array, comparing values, generating html and appending it to an html element. 

The end result can be viewed here: sbuijs.github.io/memory-js/
